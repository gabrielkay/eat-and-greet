# Eat & Greet

### What is Eat & Greet?

Eat & Greet is a mealsharing app that connects you to fellow newcomers for a meal at local restaurants. It is designed for people who are new to an area and looking to make friends. The site currently supports 6 of the most populated US cities as well as Durham, Boulder, and Washington DC, the locations of Viget's 3 offices. You can check it out at [eatandgreet.us](https://eatandgreet.us/)

### Starting a local server
In order to run this on a local server:
1. Make sure you have postgres running
2. install all dependencies locally by running `bundle install` in the project repo
3. run `rake db:create` followed by `rake db:migrate`
4. get your local server started by running `rails s`

You may need to install ruby 2.6.3 beforehand with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36485180/how-to-update-ruby-with-homebrew).
